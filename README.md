hi, i'm julia! ðŸ‘‹ 

i'm currently a sophomore at stanford university studying computer science with a focus on artificial intelligence to tackle sociopolitical issues. i want to use technology to fight for an equitable future focused on community care and free of exploitative institutions and unjust practices. at the same time, i understand technology's limitations and strive to use my understanding of it to ensure that it is used ethically. 

i would love to collaborate on any projects making strides towards the liberation of marginalized folks and the planet. you can reach me at juliabiswas@stanford.edu
