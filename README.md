Hi there, I'm Julia! ðŸ‘‹ 

I study Computer Science and Asian American Studies at Stanford University, and my work focuses on using artificial intelligence to tackle sociopolitical issues. I'm currently at The Data Nutrition Project, where I'm employing machine learning and data analysis to examine the impact of data bias against Asian American Pacific Islander communities and contributing to a framework that can determine when race data can and should be included in algorithmic decision-making systems. 

I would love to collaborate on any technical projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized folks and the planet. You can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
