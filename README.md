Hi there, I'm Julia! I'm currently a Master's student at Stanford University studying Computer Science with a focus on Human-Computer Interaction. I'm passionate about developing socially impactful products, and I would love to collaborate on any projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized people and the planet. You can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
