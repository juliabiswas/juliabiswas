hi there, i'm julia! ðŸ‘‹ 

i'm studying computer science and asian american studies at stanford university to develop ai to tackle sociopolitical issues. i'm an incoming software development engineer intern at amazon; previously, i was at the data nutrition project, applying machine learning and data analysis to examine the impact of data bias against asian american pacific islander communities and contribute to the team's framework on ethically involving race data in ai.

i would love to collaborate on any technical projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized folks and the planet. you can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
