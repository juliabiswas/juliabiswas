Hi there, I'm Julia! ðŸ‘‹ 

I study Computer Science and Asian American Studies at Stanford University, and my work focuses on using artificial intelligence to tackle sociopolitical issues. I'm currently at The Data Nutrition Project, where I'm employing machine learning and data analysis to examine the impact of data bias against Asian American Pacific Islander communities and contribute to a framework that can determine if and when race data should be included in AI systems. 

I would love to collaborate on any technical projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized folks and the planet. You can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
