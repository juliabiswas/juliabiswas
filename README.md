Hi there, I'm Julia! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an engineer, writer, and designer.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Asian American Studies at Stanford University, developing AI focused on tackling sociopolitical issues. I would love to collaborate on any projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized people and the planet. You can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
