Hi there, I'm Julia! ðŸ‘‹ I'm an engineer, writer, and designer.

I'm currently studying Computer Science and Asian American Studies at Stanford University, with the goal of developing AI to tackle sociopolitical issues. I would love to collaborate on any technical projects making strides toward the liberation of marginalized folks and the planet. You can reach me at jubiswas@stanford.edu!
